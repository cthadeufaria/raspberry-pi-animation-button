# Raspberry Pi Prize Selector

This application is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 5. It uses a state machine to select a random prize from a list when a button is pressed, and plays a corresponding video using OpenCV. After the prize video is played, an idle video loops while waiting for the next button press.
